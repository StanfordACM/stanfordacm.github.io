    <p>Reimagining Windows: Low-level changes in Windows 8</p>
    <p><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> The Windows development team set out to “reimagine” the OS for Windows 8. Much of the recent press has focused on the most visible result of this process – a new touch-friendly user interface. Eric’s talk will focus on some of the less-visible but equally important innovations that have been made at the lower levels of the OS. Eric Traut (’93 BS CSE) oversees the development of the core components in the Windows operating system including the kernel, virtualization, storage and security.</small></p>

    <p>What's New and Different about Web-Scale Multimedia Processing?</p><p><small><strong>Abstract:</strong> It's a cliche to say that the Internet has changed our world.  But the proliferation of inexpensive and ubiquitous multimedia devices is changing our world even more. The last time I checked Flickr has hundreds of thousands of pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge --- That's more than one a foot.    I'd like to address the three questions and opportunities presented by multimedia: Does content matter?  Is it information or entertainment?  And just what is a tag?  I'll talk about the issue, the opportunity and some of the algorithic solutions that are possible.  But there is much work to be done.</small></p>

<section class="leadin">
  The Association for Computing Machinery, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery">ACM</a>, was founded in 1947 as the world’s first scientific and educational computing society. Its membership was approximately 83,000 as of 2007.

<section class="leadin">
  The Stanford chapter of the ACM currently has 400+ members. We serve the Stanford community by planning and organizing numerous industry, academic, and social events each quarter.

  <h1>Meet Your ACM Officers</h1>

  <h2>Feross Aboukhadijeh (President)</h2>
  <img src="/files/feross.jpg">
  <p><a href="http://www.feross.org">Feross</a> is a Stanford CS student &amp; senior. Last summer, he worked at <a href="http://www.quora.com">Quora</a> where he launched video and helped port the site to Scala. The summer before that, he worked at Facebook where he helped build the new version of <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/">Facebook Groups</a>. He also built <a href="http://ytinstant.com">YouTube Instant</a>, which got a million visitors within 10 days of release. In 2008, he did CURIS research in HCI. He's also been a CS section leader for 5 quarters. Feross loves the web, video, computer security, and education. In his free time, Feross likes to run, play basketball &amp; video games, and watch anime.

  <h2>Jake Becker (Vice-President)</h2>
  <img src="/files/jake.jpg">
  <p>Jake is a senior in Computer Science at Stanford, specializing in systems and web applications. He created the music website <a href="http://instant.fm/">Instant.fm</a> with Feross as his senior project, and has worked as a <a href="http://cs198.stanford.edu">section-leader for the Stanford CS106 classes</a>. Jake enjoys cycling, hiking through the great outdoors, video games, and (to his slight embarassment) anime.</p>

  <h2>Alexander Atallah (Hack Competition Coordinator)</h2>
  <img src="/files/alexander.png">
  <p>Alexander Atallah (Class of 2014) is from Louisville, Colorado and really, really likes to code, particularly websites. In high school he competed in Lincoln Douglas debate and felt guilty about fiddling with programs to procrastinate on schoolwork (because he liked Econ and philosophy and was kind of academically fuzzy), but now believes that it’s perfectly acceptable.</p>

  <h2>Daniel Robbins (LAN Party Coordinator)</h2>
  <img src="/files/daniel.jpg">
  <p>Daniel Robbins is currently a Junior in Computer Science. He originates from Honolulu, Hawaii where he enjoys bodysurfing and playing volleyball. He is interested in several areas of CS including Computer Graphics, Virtual Reality, Physical Simulation, and Game Development. In 2010, Daniel participated in the CURIS research program where he built a distributed collision detection system. In his spare time, Daniel enjoys swimming, social dance, video games, and programming.</p>

  <h2>Ranjani Iyer (Financial Officer)</h2>
  <img src="/files/Ranjani.jpg">
  <p>Ranjani Iyer is sophomore from Cary, North Carolina. She is interested in computer science and economics. She is unsure of what to specialize in, and has worked on analyzing Egyptian heiroglyphics and data mining medical school applicant data at Duke University over the past few years. She is classically trained in Bharatnatyam (South-Indian dance form) and enjoys learning new forms of dance.</p>

  <h2>Kapil Yedidi (Tech Talks Coordinator)</h2>
  <img src="/files/kapil.jpg">
  <p>Kapil Yedidi is a junior majoring in Computer Science with a concentration in computer systems. Last summer he interned at Google where he worked in the Cluster Infrastructure and Management group. The previous summer he did systems research on heterogenous datacenters through the CURIS program at Stanford. During the school year, he is involved with bioinformatics research through the CS department. In his spare time he enjoys running, reading, and watching indie sci-fi movies.

  <h2>Veni Johanna (Academic Event Coordinator)</h2>
  <!-- <img src="/files/veni.jpg"> -->
  <p>Veni is a Computer Science sophomore from Jakarta, Indonesia. She is interested in building scalable systems, tech in third-world countries, CS education for women, and internationalization of web services. In high school, Veni represented and won a medal for Indonesia in International Olympiad in Informatics. Last summer, she interned at Facebook's Core Systems team. In her spare time, Veni likes to play badminton and watch cheesy movies and TV shows.</p>

  <h2>John Yang-Sammataro (Happy Hacky Hour Coordinator)</h2>

  <h2>Kingston Tam</h2>
  <img src="/files/kingston.png">
  <p>Kingston is currently a junior, majoring in Symbolic Systems with an HCI concentration. With that aside, he really likes entrepreneurship, more specifically the building cool stuff part, and design thinking (brainstorming/product-building skillz). He is involved with BASES (Stanford’s entrepreneurship group) and Design Initiative (Stanford’s newest design thinking group), launching a new <a href="http://sparksinitiative.com/">initiative</a> aimed at making it really easy for students to build and launch side-projects. He’s also an international (British boarding school) and local (lives in Palo Alto) student. If you really want, you can learn more from his nascent and developing site: <a href="http://www.kingstontam.com/">KingstonTam.com</a></p>

  <h2>Jay Patel</h2>
  <img src="/files/jay.jpg">
  <p>Jay Patel is a Sophomore at Stanford University, majoring in Computer Science. This past summer, he interned at eBay Inc, where he worked on the Platforms Team. He enjoys creating everything ranging from startups to philosophies to robots. At heart, Jay finds great contentment in conversing with different kinds of people, working on ideas as a team, and initiating effectual movements to right a wrong.</p>

  <h2>Rahul Pandey</h2>
  <img src="/files/rahul.jpg">
  <p>Rahul is originally from Rochester, Michigan, although he has grown to adore Stanford and the Bay Area. He is a junior Computer Science major and a Section Leader for the CS198 Program.
